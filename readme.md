https://github.com/leereilly/list-of-english-cliches/blob/main/cliches.txt

* is ranking (* = 1st, ** = 2nd, etc)

--cliches:
bad guy becomes good guy/turns from their ways?
power of friendship!

It WaS aLl A dReAm
Reach for the sky

--game styles:
shoot em ups
enless scrollers
story clickers




idea 1: **
you are the villain and have to stop some kids using the power of friendship
while they try to lure you to become good(story clicking game?)

Idea 2:
there are 2 versions of the map, one that cn be seen with the dream view
--can see sleep paralysis demons and stuff

Idea 3: *
reach for the sky will be maybe trying to launch player into another layer of 
space to reach their goals, and will end up becoming an endless scroller
-it being something like an old arcade space shooter is even more cliche

story element: trying to "shoot for the moon" (maybe actually trying to shoot the moon like gru)
will end up overshooting and now you have to shoot up asteroids and planets and stuff
probably includes a bunch of upgrades that can be collected from materials (contained in asteroids and stuff)
but each upgrade will take TIME and makes the ship VULNERABLE
